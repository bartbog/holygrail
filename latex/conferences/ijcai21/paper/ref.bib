abstract="Preference learning refers to the task of learning to predict (contextualized) preferences on a collection of alternatives, which are often represented in the form of an order relation, on the basis of observed or revealed preference information. Supervision in preference learning is typically weak, in the sense that only partial information about sought structures or indirect information about an underlying value function are provided; a common example is feedback in the form of pairwise comparisons between alternatives. Especially important in preference learning are ranking problems, in which preferences are represented in terms of total or partial order relations. Such problems can be approached in two fundamentally different ways, either by learning binary preferences on pairs of alternatives or by inducing an underlying (latent) value function on single alternatives.",
