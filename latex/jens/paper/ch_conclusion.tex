\section{Conclusion}
The framework of Blackburn and Bos can be used to translate a CNL into logic. This way, we assign semantics to such a CNL. Therefore, we can use such a CNL as a knowledge representation language within a knowledge base system. This allows different kinds of inference on the (constructed) natural language. For a logic grid puzzle, this can mean automatically solving the puzzle but also helping the user by giving hints or helping the author by giving the possible solutions.

Moreover, we expanded the framework with types. This allows us to translate the constructed CNL to a typed logic. We have proven that type inference is possible as well. More research into a typed CNL is definitely necessary. For example, what the value of a more complex type system is. Or if we can construct a CNL with a type system with multiple types per word. The type system can then derive the correct instance of the verb. E.g. it can differentiate between ordering drinks and ordering food.
