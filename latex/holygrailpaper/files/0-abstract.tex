Inspired by the 2019 Holy Grail Challenge, we present \ourtool, a mostly automated tool that reads the natural language clues and a list of the entities of a logic grid puzzle (also known as Zebra puzzle). The challenge is to both handle the natural language input, and to produce a human-understandable explanation of how the solution is obtained.
We achieve this by translating the natural language clues into logic using a variation on the semantical framework of Blackburn and Bos. This logical representation is then used in a novel explanation-based reasoning procedure, on top of the \idp knowledge base system. The novelty is in the ordering based on mental effort required, which is related to the number of previously derived facts needed to derive new facts. The outcome is a stepwise visualisation of the clue(s) used and the resulting changes on the grid.
This can be used both to solve a puzzle, or as a step-wise `help' function for people stuck while solving a puzzle.
