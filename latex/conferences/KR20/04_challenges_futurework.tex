With respect to \emph{efficiency}, the main bottleneck of the current algorithm is the implementation of \textit{min-explanation} which requires repeatedly searching for a MUS for increasing constraint sets., which is a hard problem by itself.
Therefore, in future work we want to investigate unsat-core \emph{optimization} with respect to a cost-function, either by taking inspiration for instance from the MARCO algorithm~\cite{liffiton2013enumerating} but adapting it to prune based on cost-functions instead of subset-minimality, or alternatively by reduction to quantified Boolean formulas or by using techniques often used there~\cite{QBF,DBLP:journals/constraints/IgnatievJM16}.
