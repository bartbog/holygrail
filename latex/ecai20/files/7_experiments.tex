data, machines

\subsection{Q1: Abstraction level}
Some experiment with different levels of abstraction (e.g. all constraints at once, clues separate but all implicit at once, 2 groups of implicits, full split of implicits)
with 'set of measures', so probably a table

\subsection{Q2: Algorithmic comparison}
Both with the 'set of measures' table and computationally

\subsection{Q3: ablation analysis}
Leaving some parts of the algo out, to see step-wise improvements of the components?

\subsection{Q4: perceived quality}
Compare with the tutorial puzzle of logicgridpuzzles.com?

Ideally, a small human evaluation (e.g. ask people to solve a 3-with-3 puzzle and note the order of derivations and clues used, compare this 'ranking' to our ranking, discuss some differences.
