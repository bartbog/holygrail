The working of our system is demonstrated on \url{bartbog.github.io/zebra}. This webpage contains for some puzzles: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item All the the clues, and which (minor) modifications to the natural language formulation we implemented. 
 \item The lexicon that is required to parse the puzzles (semi-automatically generated).
 \item The resulting idp theory associated to each of the clues.
 \item Runnable \idp files to either solve the puzzle, or generate the explanations. 
 \item The visualization of the explanation by derivation steps. 
\end{itemize}
The website is still under construction and will be updated with more puzzles in the near future.
