Inspired by the 2019 Holy Grail Challenge \cite{}, we present \ourtool,  an end-to-end solution for solving logic grid puzzles (also known as Zebra puzzles) and explaining in human-understandable terms how this solution can be obtained from the clues. 

\todo{A bit more on the working}

\todo{Possibly something on the tools under the hood? \mycite{idp} \cite{bos} \cite{postagger} ... Can also come later. Maybe better in the next section. }

\todo{A paragraph on the importance of such explanations/the broader use}

\todo{Einstein puzzle as a running example? Adapt all our sentences used to that one maybe. Or a different one since the zebra puzzle is quite simple (quite simple clues)}
