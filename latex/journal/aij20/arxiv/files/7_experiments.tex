Using logic grid puzzles as a use-case, we validate the feasibility of finding non-redundant explanation sequences and generating nested explanation sequences.
As data, we use puzzles from Puzzle Baronâ€™s Logic Puzzles Volume 3~\cite{logigrammen}.
The first 10 puzzles were used to construct the grammar; the next 10 to test the genericity of the grammar.
%\bart{In onze experiementen hebben we acht (+1) puzzels. Is daar een reden voor??? Ik zou tien verwachten (ofwel de eerste ofwel de laatste tien...}
Our experiments below are on test puzzles only; we also report results on the \textit{pasta} puzzle, which was sent to us by someone who did not manage to solve it himself.

As constraint solving engine, we use \idp~\cite{IDP} due to the variety of inference methods it supports natively.
The algorithms themselves are written in embedded LUA, which provides an imperative environment inside the otherwise declarative \idp system.
The code was not optimized for efficiency and can at this point not be used in an interactive setting, as it takes between 15 minutes to a few hours to fully explain a logic grid puzzle.
Experiments were run on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1225 with 4 cores and 32 Gb memory, running linux 4.15.0 and \idp 3.7.1.

\end{table}


\myparagraph{Sequence composition}
We first investigate the properties of the puzzles and the composition of the resulting sequence explanations. The results are shown in Table~\ref{table:composition}. The first column is the puzzle identifier, where the puzzle identified as p is the pasta puzzle, our running example. 
The next 3 columns show properties of the puzzle:
$|type|$ is the number of types (e.g. person, sauce) while $|dom|$ is the number of entities of each type and $|grid|$ is the number of cells in the grid, i.e.\ the number of literals in the maximal consequence interpretation $I_n=max(\emptyset, \allconstraints)$.
Coincidentally, almost all the puzzles have 4 types with domain size 5,  hence 150 cells, except for the pasta puzzle which has a domain size of 4, thus 96 cells.

Columns 5 and 6 show the amount of steps ($\# steps$) in the explanation sequences found, and $\overline{cost}$ is the average cost of an explanation step in the puzzle. The number of inference steps is around 110-120 for all but the pasta puzzle, which is related to the grid size.

The rest of the columns investigate the proportion of inference steps in the explanation sequence, e.g. the trivial steps using just one bijection constraint (\textbf{1 bij.}), one transitivity constraint (\textbf{1 trans.}) or one clue (\textbf{1 clue}) and no other constraints; and the more complex inference steps using one clue and some implicit (bijectivity or transitivity) constraint (\textbf{1 clue+i}), multiple implicit constraints (\textbf{mult i.}). 
We can observe (see \ref{obs:1:implicitconstraints}) around 30\% of steps are simple bijectivity steps (e.g. completing a row or column in one relation), around 50\% are transitivity steps (except for the pasta puzzle) and up to 3 \% use just a single clue (see \ref{obs:2:cluespropagate}). 
The majority of the steps involving clues use a more complex combination of a clue with other constraints. 
We see that while our method can combine multiple clues, the explanations generated never require combining multiple clues in one inference step (\textbf{mult c.} always 0, see \ref{obs:3:cluesusedindependently}), that is, the method always find simpler steps involving just one clue. 
Also notably, the puzzles from the booklet never require combining implicit constraints, while the harder pasta puzzle does. 
In general, less then $1/5$th of the explanations actually need to use a clue or a combination of a clue and implicit constraints.
Note that however, for puzzle 3, it is not possible to find new facts based on clue information only, it has to be combined with 1 or multiple constraints.

\myparagraph{Sequence progression}
The left side of Figure \ref{fig:steps} shows a visualisation of the type of explanation used in each of the explanation steps for the hardest puzzles 1,2 and p (puzzles with the highest average step cost). 
We can see that typically at the beginning of the sequence, individual clues (3rd line) and some individual bijectivity (1st line) and transitivity (2nd line) constraints are used, i.e., trivial ones.
This is then followed by a series of clues that also involve bijectivity/transitivity constraints, after which a large fraction of the table can be completed with bijectivity/transitivity, followed by a few last clue/implicit constraint combinations and another round of completion.
The exception to this is the pasta puzzle.
We can see that after around 20 steps where mostly clues have been used, twice a combination of implicit logigram constraints must be used to derive a new fact, after which the table can be easily completed with bijectivity/transitivity and twice the use of a clue.

\myparagraph{Explanation size}
Our cost-function is constructed to favour few (if any) clues and constraints in the explanations, and a small number of previously derived facts $|E|$.
Table~\ref{table:sequence_level}, first 5 columns, shows the average number of facts used per type of constraints used in the explanation.
We can observe that the average number of facts used is indeed low, less than two (column 'all').
The breakdown per type of constraint shows that bijectivity typically uses more facts: it either uses three `negative' facts in one row to infer a `positive' fact, as in Figure~\ref{fig:zebrascreen} or it uses one `positive' fact to infer three negative facts.
Note that for such an intuitive constraint, the number of facts used does not matter much. 
Transitivity, by nature, always uses two previously derived facts.
When an explanation involves a clue, few facts are involved on average. 

The rest of the columns take a closer look at the number of facts used when the explanation involves a clue. We can see that our approach successfully finds small explanations: many clues (the trivial ones) use no facts, while some use 1 fact and only occasionally 2 or more facts are needed. 
The puzzles 1, 2, 9 and pasta require the use of 3 facts or more together with a clue corresponding to the puzzles with the highest amounts of clues with implicit constraints. Only puzzle 1 requires clues to be combined with more than 3 facts.
Even though puzzle 9 has a lower cost, the fact it uses more than 3 facts combined with a clue is linked to a complex clue formulation.


Notably the amount of facts for explanations requiring clues, is equal to 0 half of the time, which means that the new information can 
be derived independently of other new facts. 
Part of the clues with 1 fact are linked to the clue involving constraints, namely clues combined with bijectivity as they can derive  3 new facts from only 1 fact.
Altogether clues with 0 or 1 facts form more than 80 \% of the explanations using clues with facts. 

\myparagraph{Nested explanations}

We next investigate the explanation cost of the different steps in an explanation sequence, and which ones we can find a nested explanation for. 
Figure \ref{fig:steps}, right side, 
shows for a few puzzles the explanation cost of each explanation step; for each step it is also indicated whether or not a nested explanation can be found (those where one was found are indicated by a dot in the figure). 
The first observation we can draw from the side-by-side figures, is peaks with nested explanations (on the right) overcome with almost all peaks on the left. Simply put, for each of the non-trivial explanations, we are most often able to find a nested explanation that can provide a more detailed explanation using contradiction. 
Secondly, we observe that the highest cost steps involve more than one constraint: either a clue and some implicit constraints, or a combination of implicit constraints (only in the pasta puzzle). 
The harder pasta puzzle also has a higher average cost, as was already reported in Table~\ref{table:composition}. 

As the explanation sequence progresses, the cost of difficult explanation steps also increases, meaning that we can find easy explanations in the beginning, but we will require more complex reasoning to find new facts that unlock more simpler steps afterwards. 
This is especially visible from the trend line that fits all each puzzle's nested explanation dots on the right side of Figure \ref{fig:steps}.

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Properties of the nested explanations.}
	\label{table:nested_explanation}
\end{table}

We now have a closer look at the composition of these nested explanations in Table~\ref{table:nested_explanation}.
When looking at the percentage of reasoning steps that have a nested explanation, we see that only a fraction of all steps have a nested explanation. 
As the figures already indicated, when looking at the non-trivial steps, we see that for all of those our method is able to generate a nested sequence that explains the reasoning step using contradiction. 

When looking at the number of steps in a nested sequence, we see that the nested explanations are rather small: from 2 to 4 steps.
The subsequent columns in the table show the composition of the nested explanations, in terms of the types of constraints used. 
The majority of those are simple steps involving just a single constraint (a single bijectivity, transitivity or clue). 
Interestingly, even in nested explanations which typically explain a '1 clue+i.' step, the nested explanation also has a step involving a clue and at least one other implicit constraint. 
Detailed inspection showed this was typically the final step, which is a contradiction in the clue as in Figure~\ref{fig:pasta_diff}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/violin_plot.pdf}
	\caption{Distribution of the ratio of the cost of a nested explanation sequence step and the cost of original explanation step for all puzzles. 
	} 
	\label{fig:experiments:violin}
\end{figure}

We can further look at the \textit{cost} of the different steps in a nested explanation, which we use as a proxy for difficulty of the steps. 
Figure \ref{fig:experiments:violin} displays a violin plot of the ratio of the cost of a nested step divided by the cost of the original parent step that it is contributing to explain; a wider region indicates a higher density of steps having that ratio. 
Note that by Definition~\ref{def:nested-problem}, a step in a nested explanation can never be as costly or more costly than its parent step (always below the top orange line, though it often comes close).
The figure shows us that there are many steps with a cost of only a fraction of the parent step (near 0-10\% of the original cost), but also some steps closer but still a bit simpler than the parent step. 
Due to the construction of the cost function in Section~\ref{sec:zebra} with each clue contributing a value of '100' and each fact only a value of '1', this means it typically involves fewer previously derived facts, which should make it easier to understand.
