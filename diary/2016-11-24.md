# Meeting thesis 24 november 2016

the norwegian lives in a house that is next to the blue house
`!x1: lives(norwergian, x1) => ?x2: is_next_to(x1, x2) & color(x2, blue).`
`!x1: !x2: lives(norwegian, x1) & color(x2, blue) => is_next_to(x1, x2).`
There is a blue house next to the house in which the norwegian lives.
Nu: norwegian lives in a house or all houses next to a house are not blue

there is a person who lives in the green house and drinks coffee
`∃ x1: ∀ x2: color(x2, green) => lives(x1, x2) ∧ drinks(x1, coffee).`
"Als hem niet in het huis woont, mag het huis niet groen zijn"

- binaire quantificatie: welke 2 leden 
- ? ! vooral probleem
- that is subsentence eens bekijken of die nog problemen geeft.

- every depertament with a large budget, has at least 1 paid employee

Best eerste quantoren, dan andere puzzle

- ! ? of ? ! niet in zelfde scope => Warning?

# Week van 24 november t.e.m. 1 december 2016

- [ ] The: both existential and universal quantification?
    - The blue house is next to the red house
        - `! h1: blue(h1) => (!h2: red(h2) => next(h1, h2))`
        - `? h1: blue(h1) & (?h2: red(h2) & next(h1, h2))`
    - so not assuming there is exactly one but do assume there is at least one!
    - See difference with:
    - Every blue house is next to the red house.
    - The above doesn't assume there is a blue house. The first sentence does
