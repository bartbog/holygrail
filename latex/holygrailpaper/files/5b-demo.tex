The working of our system is demonstrated on the following website \url{TODO -- FIND WAY TO PUBLISH ON AI WEBSITE}. This webpage contains for some puzzles: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item An overview of the clues.
 \item The lexicon that is required to parse the puzzles. For some puzzles, this is constructed manually since the automated chunking method does not always produce the required results yet. 
 \item The resulting idp theory associated to each of the clues
 \item Runnable \idp files to either  solve the puzzle, or generate the explanations. 
 \item The visualization of the generated explanations. 
\end{itemize}
The website is still under construction and will be updated with more puzzles in the near future.
