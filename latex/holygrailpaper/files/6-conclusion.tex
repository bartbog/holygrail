In this paper, we presented \ourtool, a tool focused on explaining the solution process of logic grid puzzles.
For the explanation part, we developed a method that prioritizes derivation steps according to the mental effort required to understand them. 
This tool has the potential to work end-to-end, but preliminary experiments show that due to inaccuracies or ambiguities in the NLP parts, manual intervention in the lexicon construction or clue formulation may be needed. 

Future work includes combining the NLP interpretation with the solving, so that different interpretations are tried if the corresponding logic formulation does not yield a solution. Another interesting avenue is to expand the work on explanations to other satisfaction problems, where the abstraction in terms of high-level \textit{clues} may be less obvious.
