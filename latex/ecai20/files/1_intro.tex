Need for explanations of reasoning systems

Shallow related work on quickxplain, 'explanations' in search, etc.

HolyGrail challenge and related work

Difference automated reasoning and human reasoning, measuring cognitive load

challenge 1: abstraction in self-contained reasoning step

challenge 2: ordering

challenge 3: computation efficiency

Contributions: (eerste aanzet!!!)

\begin{itemize}
	\item Formalize the problem of finding good ordering of self-contained reasoning steps
	\item Investigate different interpretations of good ordering and self-contained
	\item Propose algorithms to approximate the ???some hardness result??? problem of finding the best ordering
	\item Experimentally demonstrate the quality and feasibility of the approach
\end{itemize}


\bart{Mention running example? Mention that this is a very hard puzzle (80 people at an AI conference received it; 4 solved it; many more tried)? }
