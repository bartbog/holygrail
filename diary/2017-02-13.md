  - Five thieves (https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/47442/logic-problem-about-five-thieves)
> Five thieves are about to strike. Each one will play a specific role: the hacker will disconnect the security system, the overlooker will check the environment, the driver will be ready for the escape in the car, the driller will break the safety box and the accessory after the fact should be ready to get rid of the booty. The five thieves are called Albert, Bob, Charley, Damian and Ernest.
> 
> Who hired them (the boss) wants them to meet, so that they can know each other, since some of them have never met before (but others have already coincided in other misdeeds).
> 
> The hacker and the overlooker do not attend to the meeting. The boss realizes that: Bob will never know the accessory after the fact, Charley knows the driver, Damian knows only one of the thieves, Ernest knows three of them, Albert knows only two of them, the hacker is the only one which knows only one other, and finally the overlooker knows other three.
> 
> Which character plays which role?
