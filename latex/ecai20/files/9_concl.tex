We presented... it is awesome.

Future work:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item QBF or SO encoding
 \item Dedicated unsat core optimization algorithm
  \item Sequence vs steps
  \item learning the cost-function based on traces of users
  \item 
\end{compactitem}
\bart{there is enough material in future work already to fill an FWO aspirant, or FWO project. To be discussed after the deadline}

Higher order? How to deal with search; optimisation? .


\tias{Should this paragraph be here? It seems to undermine our proposed approach... maybe to future work?}
In principle our problem of finding subset-minimal (or even, see the next paragarph, cost-optimal) justifications could be solved by specifying it in such a way in second-order logic and subsequently finding models for it, e.g. by a reduction to QBF \cite{kr/BogaertsTS16,kr/vanderHallenJ18}. 
However, since this is already an $\exists\forall\exists SO$ specification, we expect this approach not be feasible (this expectation remains to be verified in future work).
