Our goal is now
GIVEN:


	
An unsatisfiable theory T

FIND:


	
A subset T' of T

SUCH THAT:


	
A certain set of constraints on T' holds  (e.g., at most one of... ) 
	T' is optimal with respect to some criterion (can also be seen as "a certain set of constraints"
	T' is still unsatisfiable 
	
	
	SOLUTION:
I suppose that the constraints and optimality can be phrased in MIP. 
	
	In that case: 
Every model of a subset of T yields a SS of T. 
We know that every solution to our problem will hit its complement for sure.  
So "optimal hitting sets of complements of such sets that satisfy the MIP constraints" are certainly an upper bound on the "good" solutions. 

Now... if we have such an optimal hitting set that satisfies the MIP constraints... 
And the SAT call yields UNSAT, then it is still a solution!
