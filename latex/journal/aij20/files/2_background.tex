While our proposed method is applicable to constraint satisfaction problems in general, we use \textit{logic grid puzzles} as example domain, as it requires no expert knowledge to understand.
Our running example is a puzzle about people having dinner in a restaurant and ordering different types of pasta. 
It is the hardest logic grid puzzle we encountered (as a reference, at a recent AI conference, when presenting our tool \cite{DBLP:conf/bnaic/ClaesBCGG19}, only four out of 80 researchers who tried managed to solve it).    
The entire puzzle can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:zebrascreen}; the full final explanation generated for it can be found at \url{http://bartbog.github.io/zebra/pasta}.

In this section, we first present logic grid puzzles as a use case, and introduce the necessary background used in section \ref{sec:problem-definition} formalizing the problem definition.


\textbf{Logic grid puzzles.}
A logic grid puzzle (also known as Zebra puzzle or Einstein puzzle) consists of natural language sentences (from hereon referred to as ``clues'') over a set of \emph{entities} occurring in those sentences. 
For instance, our running example in Figure~\ref{fig:zebrascreen} contains as second clue ``The person who chose arrabiata sauce is either Angie or Elisa'' and (among others) entities ``arrabiata sauce'', ``Angie'' and ``Elisa''. 

The set of entities is sometimes left implicit if it can be derived from the clues, but often it is given in the form of a grid. 
Furthermore, in such a puzzle the set of entities is partitioned into equally-sized groups (corresponding to \emph{types}); in our example, ``person'' and ``sauce'' are two such types. 
% 
The goal of the puzzle is to find relations between each two types such that
\begin{compactitem}
	\item \textit{Each clue is respected}; 
	\item \textit{Each entity of one type is matched with exactly one entity of the second type}, e.g., each person chose exactly one sauce and each sauce is linked to one person (this type of constraint will be referred to as \emph{bijectivity}); and 
	\item \textit{The relations are logically linked}, e.g., if Angie chose arrabiata sauce and arrabiata sauce was paired with farfalle, then Angie must also have eaten farfalle (from now on called \emph{transitivity}). 
\end{compactitem}

In Section \ref{sec:holistic}, we explain how we obtain a vocabulary and first-order theory in a mostly automated way from the clues. 
The result is a vocabulary with types corresponding to the groups of entities in the clues, and the names and types of the binary relations to find (e.g \textit{chose(person, sauce)}, \textit{paired(sauce, pasta)}, \textit{eaten(person, pasta)});
as well as constraints (first-order sentences) corresponding to the clues, and the bijectivity and transitivity constraints. 
% Formally and for future references, let us define $T_P$ as the theory containing all of these constraints for a given puzzle $P$. 

\begin{property}
	Let $T_P$ be the theory containing the first-order sentences, the bijectivity and the transitivity constraints for a given puzzle $P$. 
\end{property}

\myparagraph{Typed first-order logic.}

Our constraint solving method is based on \emph{typed first-order logic}. %, with links to \emph{typed second-order logic}.
Part of the input is a logical vocabulary consisting of a set of type symbols, (typed) constant symbols, and (typed) relation symbols with associated type signature (i.e., each relation symbol is typed $T_1\times \dots \times T_n$ with $n$ types $T_i$).
\footnote{We here omit function symbols since they are not used in this paper.} 
For example, type \textit{person} with constant symbol \textit{Angie} of type \textit{person} and a relation \textit{chose(.,.)} with signature \textit{person $\times$ sauce}.


A \emph{first-order theory} is a set of sentences (well-formed variable-free first-order formulas in which each quantified variable has an associated type), also referred to as constraints.
Since we work in a fixed and finite domain, the vocabulary, the interpretation of the types (the domains) and the constants are fixed.
This justifies the following definition. 
\begin{definition}\label{def:partial-interpretation}
 A \emph{(partial) interpretation} is a finite set of literals, i.e., expressions of the form $P(\ddd)$ or $\lnot P(\ddd)$ where $P$ is a relation symbol typed $T_1\times\dots \times T_n$ and $\ddd$ is a tuple of domain elements where each $d_i$ is of type $T_i$. 
\end{definition}
 \begin{definition}\label{def:consistent}
 A partial interpretation is \emph{consistent} if it does not contain both an atom and its negation, it is called a \emph{full} interpretation if it either contains $P(\ddd)$ or $\lnot P(\ddd)$ for each well-typed atom $P(\ddd)$. 
\end{definition}

For instance, in the partial interpretation $I_{Ang-Ar}=\{chose(Angie,arrabiata),$ $\lnot chose(Elisa,arrabiata)\}$ it is known that $Angia$ had arrabiata sauce and Elisa did not. 
\begin{property}\label{prop:precise}
	A partial interpretation $I_1$ is \emph{more precise} than partial interpretation $I_2$ (notation $I_1\geqp I_2$) if $I_1\supseteq I_2$.
\end{property}

By way of example, the partial interpretation $\{chose(Angie,arrabiata)$, $\lnot chose(Elisa,arrabiata)$, $ \lnot chose(damon,arrabiata)\}$ is more precise than $I_{Ang-Ar}$. 

% \myparagraph{Model Expansion}

For practical purposes, since variable-free literals are also sentences, we will freely use a partial interpretation as (a part of) a theory in solver calls or in statements of the form $I\land T \models J$, meaning that everything in $J$ is a consequence of $I$ and $T$, or stated differently, that $J$ is less precise than any model $M$ of $T$ satisfying $M\geqp I$. 

In the context of first-order logic, the task of finite-domain constraint solving is better known as \emph{model expansion} \cite{MitchellTHM06}: given a logical theory $T$ (corresponding to the constraint specification) and a partial interpretation $I$ with a finite domain (corresponding to the initial domain of the variables), find a model $M$ more precise than $I$ (a partial solution that satisfies $T$).
