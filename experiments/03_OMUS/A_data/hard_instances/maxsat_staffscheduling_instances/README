     Partial Weighted MaxSAT instances for Staff Scheduling
===============================================================

This archive contains 12 partial weighted MaxSAT instances which describe realistic staff scheduling
instances. A solution to an instance with cost X can be directly translated into a feasible schedule
with cost X.

The instances were used in the paper:
"Modeling and solving staff scheduling with partial weighted MaxSAT.
 2016 Demirovic, Musliu, Winter" (draft)

The original instances in plaintext which served as a basis for our
instances, as well as a description of them can be found at:
http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztc/NRP/index.html (New Instances 1-12)
and
http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztc/NRP/instances1_24.html

All of the instances are formatted in DIMACS CNF format
(see http://www.maxsat.udl.cat/rules/index.html).

For a detailed description of the MaxSAT model and the encodings used
for generating the instances please refer to our paper which is available
