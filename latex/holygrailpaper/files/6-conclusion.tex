In this paper, we presented \ourtool, a tool focused on explaining the solution process of logic grid puzzles.
For general explanations, we developed a method that prioritizes inferences according to the mental effort required to understand them. 
In principle, this tool works end-to-end, but in practice, preliminary experiments show that  it still requires manual intervention now and then,  to construct the lexicon and sometimes to slightly rewrite the clue to make them pareseable by our grammar. 
As such, the most important topic for future work is further automation of the NLP component of \ourtool.
