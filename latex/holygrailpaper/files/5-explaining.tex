A part of the holy grail challenge was not to just solve the puzzle, but also to \emph{explain} how the solution was obtained, or rather, to explain how a human could obtain this solution as well. 
The idea under our is that we will gradually fill the logigram grid with more and more information. At each point in time, information is added that can be obtained by reasoning on the clues and by using the partial solution obtained this far. 
In order to make the explanations as simple as possible we proritize our propagations BLABLA: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item 
\end{itemize}


To this end, we made use of \idp's procedural interface (the lua scripting language) and its ability to perform propagation on given constraints.
