        "The couple who toured the fort didn't buy the chocolate fudge but loved what Alex and Alyssa Frost bought.",
        "Jack's horse almost threw him off, but he and his wife still managed to have a good time! Peter, who isn't married to Tracy, wanted to go sight seeing with Alex but he went kayaking with his wife instead.",
        "Of the five couples, there are: Mr. and Mrs. Hartford, the couple who bought the fudge, Jodie Smothers, Alex, and the couple who went horseback riding.",
        "Allen is not Tracy's husband and Alice is not Marks's wife. Mark didn't rent a bicycle built for two.",
        "The couple who went site seeing bought a beautiful model lighthouse at one of the local gift shops. The Lighthouse and Suzy's model ship were voted the best of the souvenirs.",
        "Mark, who is not married to Jodie, liked the maple syrup that Jack bought. Allen bought the postcards."
